### Pages & Routes

| Path | Page | Category | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `/` | Home | - | Dashboard with quick actions |
| `/upload-ps` | UploadPS | Database | Upload PocketSmith CSV data |
| `/refresh-ps` | RefreshPS | Transactions | Refresh data via PocketSmith API; tabbed view (Review & Edit New / New Transactions / Modified) with inline transaction editing using shared `TransactionTable` + `TransactionEditModal` + `CategorySelector`. Selection checkboxes enabled for multi-select bulk operations. Accept All button in header; bulk Category button appears when rows selected. Per-row action buttons for Category, Split, Neutralize, and Accept. Clickable Date, Description, and Category cells open edit modals. **Date edit:** Click date cell to open modal with `<input type="date">`, saves via `PATCH /api/v2/transactions/:id`. When the date changes and the transaction currency differs from base currency, the server automatically recalculates `base_amount` using an implied FX rate derived from a nearby transaction (same currency, ±3 days, largest amount for stability). Toast shows old → new USD amount and the implied rate. **Bulk Category:** Select multiple rows via checkboxes, click "Category (N)" button to assign same category to all selected. **Split:** Per-row button opens a modal to divide the original amount across 2-5 entries with optional category selection. Uses `POST /api/v2/transactions/:id/split`. **Neutralize:** Per-row button creates an offsetting entry for brokerage security trades (cash-for-shares exchange). Both transactions categorized as "Transfer - Securities Trades" and marked accepted. Uses `POST /api/v2/transactions/:id/neutralize`. |
| `/backup-database` | BackupDatabase | Database | Download database backup |
| `/budget-worksheet` | BudgetWorksheetV2 | Budgeting | Redesigned budget worksheet with two-panel layout: balance comparison table (left) and budget entry form (right sidebar) always visible simultaneously. Compact toolbar with collapsible filter panel using **HierarchyFilter** pill-style components for categories (All/Income/Expense/Transfers with counts + checklist) and accounts (BS COA hierarchy groups with counts + checklist), matching the transaction pages filter pattern. PeriodSelector for date range. Reset + Apply buttons in filter footer. Active filter chips with one-click removal. KPI cards for Total Actual, Total Budget, and Difference. Balance table with double-click drill-down on Actual/Budget cells (opens existing popup modals for viewing/editing entries). Entry form auto-fills category from filter selection, supports math expressions in amount field (e.g. "100+50"), auto-calculates base amount via FX rates, and handles "All" months batch entry. Right-click context menu on category chip/badge/field opens floating CategorySelector popover for quick category switching without opening filters. Budget year defaults from Program Settings. Expense sign modal warns when positive amounts entered for expense categories. |
| `/budget-realization` | BudgetRealization | Budgeting | Budget vs actual comparison with KPI summary cards (Income, Expenses, Net Cash Flow, Savings Rate) |
| `/budget-graph` | BudgetRealizationGraph | Budgeting | Visual budget analysis |
| `/budget-variances` | BudgetVariances | Budgeting | Line items ranked by largest variance |
| `/budget-fx` | BudgetFX | Budgeting | Monthly budget FX rates per currency per year. Year selector, 12-month table with double-click editing, per-month Recalculate from average actual FX with preview modal. Uses `budget_fx_rates` DB table. |
| `/forecast-mapping` | FCLineMapping | Forecasting | Step 1 — FC Inc/Exp Mapping. Define FC Lines, assign budget categories via drag/drop (Ctrl+Click multi-select), set line types. "Generate Suggestions" opens selectable checklist of P&L parent accounts (only shows names not yet created). Independent scroll panels. Coverage bar, budget totals, category detail modal. Unassigned list excludes children of assigned parents (recursive CTE). |
| `/forecast-scenarios` | FCScenarios | Forecasting | Step 2 — Manage forecast scenarios. "+ New Scenario" immediately prompts for name. Target Cash field for auto-balance. Copy scenario with optional "Update base values from actuals" checkbox. |
| `/forecast-modules` | FCModuleManage | Forecasting | Step 3 — Configure BS modules. "Add from Actuals" creates modules from year-end balances (tree view with Select All/Clear). Setup status tracking (New/In Progress/Complete) with color-coded badges and filter. Only "Complete" modules included in forecast generation. Edit form: Account/Name read-only when matched; Type editable from configurable list; Expense/Income Line pickers, Growth (x Inflation), Expense Amount, Income/Yield %, Tax Rate Override, Status. |
| `/forecast-setup-exp` | FCExpSetup | Forecasting | Step 4 — Income/expense forecast items. "Add from FC Lines" shows Forecast Expense/Income lines with budget pre-fill. Account/Name/Type locked for FC Line items. Setup status tracking with filter — only "Complete" items included in generation. |
| `/forecast-review` | FCReview | Forecasting | Step 5 — Review generated forecasts with KPI cards, age row (from birth year), collapsible "Change in Net Worth" equity bridge section (Operating, Tax, Asset Value Changes, Total). Cash Shortfall/Rebalance rows from target cash auto-balance. Only modules/expenses marked "Complete" are included. |
| `/fc-settings` | FCSettings | Forecasting | FC Settings — Birth Year (age row in Review), Module Types (configurable dropdown list), and FX Rate Assumptions (moved from old `/fx-options`). |
| `/balance` | BalanceV2 | Reports & Graphs | Redesigned balance sheet. KPI cards for Net Worth (highlighted), Total Assets, Total Liabilities. Compact toolbar with inline period controls (1-3 periods with P1/P2/P3 badges + date pickers), Generate button, expand/collapse icon buttons, and Export. Reuses existing `BalanceReport` component for the hierarchical account tree table with sticky headers/columns, resizable account column, row highlighting, path-based collapse state, and Net Worth footer row. Auto-generates report on page load. |
| `/cash-flow` | CashFlow | Reports & Graphs | Cash flow P&L analysis |
| `/cash-flow-monthly` | CashFlowMonthly | Reports & Graphs | Monthly cash flow breakdown |
| `/balance-chart` | BalanceChart | Reports & Graphs | Net worth chart over time |
| `/category-trend` | CategoryTrend | Reports & Graphs | Grouped bar chart comparing actual vs budget monthly values for selected income/expense categories over a standard period (YTD, This Year, Last Year, Last 6/12/24 Months). Expense values displayed as positive for visual comparison. |
| `/trans-actual` | TransActual | Transactions | Redesigned transaction explorer. KPI summary cards (per-currency totals, income/expenses). Unified toolbar with instant search bar, collapsible filter panel with **HierarchyFilter** components for categories and accounts. **Category HierarchyFilter:** Two-stage cascading filter — Stage 1 pill buttons (All / Income / Expense / Transfers), Stage 2 scrollable checklist of leaf categories under the active group. All items selected by default when a group is chosen; uncheck individual items to narrow. Right-click any item to solo-select (deselects all others). When Transfers group is active, a contextual **Match Status** toggle appears (All / Matched / Unmatched) filtering by `transfer_matched` flag. **Account HierarchyFilter:** Same pattern using BS COA hierarchy — pills for Bank Accounts, Fidelity Stock, CVC Investments, US/SP/PL Properties, Liabilities sub-groups, etc. Active filter chips with one-click removal. Contextual selection bar appears on row selection (Edit, Split, Neutralize, Delete). Clean table with custom checkboxes, hover row actions (split/neutralize icons), color-coded amounts, monospace tabular-nums. Split uses slide-in drawer instead of modal. Client-side filtering for period, account, category, description, value range. Shares `TransactionExplorer.css` with TransBudget. **Split:** `POST /api/v2/transactions/:id/split`. **Neutralize:** `POST /api/v2/transactions/:id/neutralize`. |
| `/trans-budget` | TransBudget | Transactions | Redesigned budget transaction explorer matching TransActual pattern. KPI summary cards, toolbar with search/filters/export, collapsible filter panel with **HierarchyFilter** components for categories (Income / Expense / Transfers) and accounts (COA hierarchy groups). Same two-stage cascading filter pattern as TransActual with right-click solo-select. Contextual selection bar (Edit, Delete — no split/neutralize). Default period: full year. Edit modal supports all fields (Date, Description, Amount, Currency, BaseAmount, Account, Category). Shares `TransactionExplorer.css` with TransActual. |
| `/transfer-analysis` | TransferAnalysis | Transactions | Transfer matching analysis. Select a period via PeriodSelector, then analyze all transfer-category transactions. Matches debit/credit pairs by same absolute base_amount within 5-day tolerance. Shows summary cards (matched pairs, manual groups, unmatched count/totals), collapsible category sections with matched pairs table (debit + credit side-by-side) and unmatched transactions table with checkboxes for manual matching. **Manual Match Groups:** Users can select 2+ unmatched transactions across categories and link them as a persistent match group (e.g., one lump credit matching multiple split debits). Linked groups appear in an auto-expanded "Manually Matched Groups" section with debit/credit totals, net amount, and an Unlink button. Sticky action bar appears when 2+ rows are checked, showing selection count, net base amount (green when zero, red otherwise), Link as Matched button, and Clear button. **Transfer Matched Flags:** Running analysis persists `transfer_matched` boolean on all transfer transactions in the period (true for auto-matched + manual groups, false for unmatched), enabling the Transfer Status filter on the Actuals page. Uses `GET /api/v2/transactions/transfer-analysis`, `POST/DELETE /api/v2/transfer-match-groups`. |
| `/ledger` | Ledger | Transactions | Account ledger report with running balance. Dynamic cascading dropdown selectors follow the COA hierarchy (Type → Group → Sub-Group → Account) adapting to variable tree depth (3 or 4 levels). Prominent blue account banner shows selected account name, currency badge, and record count. Collapsible filter panel with optional period filter (PeriodSelector) and **category filter** dropdown (populated from loaded transactions, filters client-side). Toolbar with search, Add transaction (slide-in drawer with date/description/amount/currency/category fields, posts `POST /api/v2/transactions` with `source:'manual'`), and Export. Table with checkbox selection, sortable columns (Date, Description, Amount, Ccy, Category, Balance), bulk edit (description/category) and delete via selection bar. Running balance computed client-side from chronological order. **Total Amount** displayed in table footer for currently filtered transactions. Uses `LEDGER_CONFIG`/`LEDGER_EDIT_CONFIG` in `transactionConfig.js` and reuses `GET /api/v2/transactions` with account filter. |
| `/fx-options` | FXOptions | Forecasting | Forecast FX assumptions (budget rates at `/budget-fx`) |
| `/coa-management` | COAManagement | Settings | Chart of accounts CRUD with tree view (expand/collapse hierarchy), horizontal toolbar (search, filters, add), inline row actions on hover (edit, delete, add child, move), PS analysis, quick-add for accounts and categories. "Add as category" toggle in Add modal for creating categories anywhere in the hierarchy. Move modal with full-tree category picker to re-parent accounts under any node. Components: `COAManagementToolbar.jsx`, `COATreeTable.jsx`, `COATreeRow.jsx`, `COAEditModal.jsx`, `COAMoveModal.jsx`, `COACategoryPicker.jsx`. |
| `/program-settings` | ProgramSettings | Settings | Application preferences (default budget year) |

### Navigation

Category landing pages instead of dropdowns. Each category has a landing page at `/<category-slug>` showing feature cards with Lucide icons. Generated from `routes.jsx` via `getCategoryRoutes()`.

### State Management

- **React Context**: `ToastContext` (global toasts), `ForecastContext` (forecast state shared across FC pages)
- **Local state**: Page-level `useState`/`useCallback` for form state, loading, and API responses
- **Shared hooks** (`hooks/`): `useAPI` (API call management with loading/error states), `useCoa` (Chart of Accounts data and derived category/account maps), `useFormState` (form state and validation), `useModal` (modal open/close with data management)
- **Feature hooks**: `useTransactionEdit`, `useTransactionDelete`, `useTransactionSelection`, `useBudgetEntrySubmit`, `useFCExpCrud` encapsulate CRUD logic with toast notifications
- **Shared utilities** (`utils/`): `formatters` (currency/number formatting), `dateHelpers` (date manipulation), `cashFlowHelpers`, `forecastHelpers`, `treeTraversal` (tree structure navigation for COA hierarchy)

### Key Patterns

- **Shared Layout**: `Layout.jsx` renders `NavigationMenu` + `Breadcrumbs` + page content + `Footer`. Reusable `MonthYearPicker` and `PeriodCountSelector` components shared across pages
- **Shared selectors**: `HierarchyFilter` (two-stage cascading filter with group pills + drill-down checklist, right-click solo-select — used on Budget Worksheet, Actual Transactions, Budget Transactions), `CategorySelector` (COA-hierarchy, searchable — used in category quick-pick popover), `AccountSelector` (currency-grouped, searchable), `PeriodSelector` (preset-based periods) — reusable across pages
- **Collapsible sections**: Budget Worksheet and Transaction pages (Actual, Budget) use a Show/Hide toggle to maximize screen space for data tables
- **Tabbed panels**: Budget Worksheet uses a tabbed interface to switch between Balances and Budget Entry in the same card, with the selected category displayed in the tab header
- **Lazy loading**: All pages except Home use `React.lazy()` with `Suspense` + `LoadingSpinner`
- **Feature modules**: 9 feature directories under `features/` (Balances, BudgetEntry, Budgets, CashFlow, Charts, COAManagement, Database, Forecast, Transaction) with hooks, utils, and table components
- **Toast notifications**: All CRUD operations use `useToast()` for success/error feedback

### Shared Components (frontend/src/components/)

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Layout | `Layout.jsx` | NavigationMenu + Breadcrumbs + page content + Footer wrapper |
| NavigationMenu | `NavigationMenu.jsx` | Top navigation bar with category links |
| Breadcrumbs | `Breadcrumbs.jsx` | Page breadcrumb trail |
| LoadingSpinner | `LoadingSpinner.jsx` | Suspense fallback spinner |
| Toast | `Toast.jsx` | Toast notification popups |
| MonthYearPicker | `MonthYearPicker.jsx` | Dual month + year select, accepts className props |
| PeriodCountSelector | `PeriodCountSelector.jsx` | Dropdown for 1-3 period counts |
| **CategorySelector** | `CategorySelector/CategorySelector.jsx` | Searchable, COA-hierarchy-ordered category selector. Accepts `plTree` (from `useCoa`) for hierarchy ordering, `selectedCategories` + `onCategoriesChange` for selection, `categoryGroupOptions` for group presets (Income all, Expense all, etc.). Includes type-to-filter search input and pinned "All" option that clears category filters. Plain click selects a single item; Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on Mac) toggles multi-select. Used on Budget Worksheet, Actual Transactions, Budget Transactions, and in `TransactionEditModal` (single-select mode via `plTree` prop). |
| **PeriodSelector** | `PeriodSelector/PeriodSelector.jsx` | Preset-based period picker with standard presets: This Month, This Month Prior Year, Last Month, Last Month Prior Year, This Year, Last Year, Custom. Auto-computes `fromMonth`/`toMonth`/`actualYear`/`budgetYear` from selected preset. "Custom" reveals manual dropdowns (Budget Year hidden via `hideBudgetYear` prop). Supports controlled + uncontrolled modes (dual-state pattern). Used on Budget Worksheet, Actual Transactions, Budget Transactions. |
| **KpiCards** | `KpiCards.jsx` | Reusable KPI summary cards with Recharts mini-charts (bar/area). Used on Budget Realization and Forecast Review pages. Supports `formattedValue` override, trend icons, and responsive grid layout via `KpiCardRow`. |
| **AccountSelector** | `AccountSelector/AccountSelector.jsx` | Searchable, currency-grouped account selector. Accepts `accountOptions` (string[]) and `accountCurrencyMap` (Map from `useCoa`) to group accounts by currency. Includes type-to-filter search, "All" option pinned at top (clears individual selections when clicked), and currency group headers (USD, EUR, etc.). Plain click selects a single item; Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on Mac) toggles multi-select. `selectedAccounts` + `onAccountsChange` for selection. Account lists fetched with `leafOnly: true` to exclude parent/grouping nodes. |
| **HierarchyFilter** | `HierarchyFilter/HierarchyFilter.jsx` | Two-stage cascading filter used on Budget Worksheet, Actual Transactions, and Budget Transactions pages. **Stage 1:** Pill buttons for top-level COA groups (e.g., All / Income / Expense / Transfers for categories; Bank Accounts / Fidelity Stock / Liabilities sub-groups for accounts). Each pill shows item count. Selecting a group includes all leaf items by default. **Stage 2:** Compact scrollable checklist of leaf items under the active group. Uncheck individual items to narrow the selection. **Right-click** any item to solo-select (deselects all others). Props: `groups` ([{ key, label, node }] from COA tree), `onSelectionChange(leafNames[])`, optional `onGroupChange(groupKey)`, optional `extraSlot` (React node rendered below checklist — used for Transfer Match Status toggle on Actuals). CSS: `HierarchyFilter.css`. |

### Visual Environment Indicators

- **Development:** Yellow/amber browser tab (`#f59e0b`), title shows "FI [DEV]"
- **Production:** Dark blue browser tab (`#1a1f36`), title shows "FI"

Controlled by `VITE_APP_MODE` in `.env-cmdrc`, implemented in `main.jsx`.

### CSS Design System

Pure vanilla CSS with CSS custom properties (no Tailwind, SCSS, or CSS-in-JS). Global design tokens defined in `index.css`:

- **Colors:** Navy blue primary (`--primary: #1e40af`), emerald accent (`--accent: #047857`), semantic success/warning/danger, financial chart palette (7 colors)
- **Typography:** "Plus Jakarta Sans" (body), "Space Grotesk" (headings), SF Mono (financial data). Weights 400-700
- **Spacing:** `--space-xs` (0.25rem) through `--space-2xl` (3rem)
- **Border radius:** `--radius-sm` (8px) through `--radius-full` (9999px)
- **Shadows:** 4 levels (soft, md, lg, xl) plus focus ring
- **Transitions:** Fast (150ms), base (200ms), slow (300ms) with cubic-bezier easing
- **Visual effects:** Glassmorphism (backdrop-filter blur), gradient backgrounds, radial gradient body overlay

### Responsive Design

Desktop-first approach with three breakpoint tiers:

| Breakpoint | Target | Key changes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `1080px` | Large tablet | 2-column grids collapse to 1-column, toolbar wraps |
| `768px` | Tablet | Hamburger nav, sidebar panels stack above content, modals go full-width, heading sizes reduce |
| `640px` | Mobile phone | Edge-to-edge navbar, full-screen modals, stacked form actions, reduced padding/font sizes, horizontal scroll for tabs/breadcrumbs, version badge hidden |

**Navigation:** Horizontal link bar inside glassmorphic pill on desktop. On mobile (768px): links hidden behind hamburger toggle, revealed as a fixed slide-out drawer (280px) with overlay backdrop. `backdrop-filter` is disabled on `.navbar__inner` at mobile to prevent CSS containing-block issues with `position: fixed` children. Brand image scales down (44px → 34px → 30px), version badge hidden at 640px. Navbar pill loses border-radius at 640px for edge-to-edge appearance.

**Tables:** Horizontal scroll via `overflow-x: auto` wrappers with gradient scroll indicators. Sticky headers with z-index layering. Reduced cell padding and font sizes at mobile breakpoints.

**Reports:** Balance sheet and cash flow use CSS custom properties (`--balance-indent-unit`, `--cashflow-indent-unit`) for tree indentation, progressively reduced at smaller breakpoints. Cash flow tree connector lines hidden at 640px.

**Modals:** Scale from fixed-width containers (`min(900px, 96vw)`) to full-screen at 640px with no border-radius. Footer action buttons stack vertically on mobile.

**Typography:** Heading sizes scale down at each breakpoint (e.g. h1: 2.25rem → 1.875rem → 1.5rem). Toast notifications reflow to fill available width at 640px.

Uses DB transaction for atomicity.
- `POST /:id/neutralize` — Create offsetting entry for brokerage security trades. Accepts optional `{ category_name }` (defaults to "Transfer - Securities Trades"). Creates a new transaction with negated amount/base_amount, same account/date/currency. Both original and offset are assigned the category and marked `accepted=true`.

- `GET /transfer-analysis?year=&month=&dateTolerance=` — Analyze transfer transactions for a period. Fetches all transactions in `is_transfer=TRUE` categories, groups by category, and matches debit/credit pairs by same absolute `base_amount` within date tolerance (default 5 days). Excludes transactions in manual match groups from auto-matching. **Side effect:** persists `transfer_matched` boolean flag on all transfer transactions in the period (true for auto-matched pairs and manual group members, false for unmatched). Returns `{ data: { [category]: { matched, unmatched, matchedCount, unmatchedCount, matchedTotal, unmatchedTotal } }, manualGroups: [{ id, note, created_at, transactions }], period }`. Repository methods: `findTransfers()`, `transferMatchGroups.findMatchedTransactionIds()`, `transferMatchGroups.findAll()`, `updateTransferMatchedFlags()`.

#### Transfer Match Groups (`/api/v2/transfer-match-groups`)
- `POST /` — Create manual match group. Body: `{ transactionIds: number[], note?: string }`. Requires 2+ IDs. Returns 409 if any transaction is already in a group. Uses DB transaction for atomicity.
- `GET /?startDate=&endDate=` — List all match groups (optionally filtered by member transaction dates). Returns groups with full transaction details.
- `DELETE /:id` — Remove a match group (cascade deletes members, returning transactions to unmatched pool).

#### Utility (`/api/v2/util`)
- `GET /appdata` (merges JSON file + PostgreSQL `app_data` table) | `POST /appdata` | `POST /backup-database`
- `GET /exchange-rates` — Bulk/historical rates | `GET /exchange-rate` — Single rate lookup | `GET /currencies`
- `GET /coa/BalanceSheet` | `GET /coa/CashFlow` | `GET /coa-traits`
- `POST /coa/add` | `POST /coa/update` | `POST /coa/delete`

### Repository Pattern

| Repository | Tables |
|-----------|--------|
| `accounts.js` | accounts |
| `categories.js` | categories |
| `transactions.js` | transactions, pending_transactions |
| `budget.js` | budget_entries, budget_versions |
| `budgetFxRates.js` | budget_fx_rates |
| `forecast.js` | forecast_scenarios, forecast_modules, forecast_income_expense, forecast_entries, and sub-tables |
| `fcLines.js` | fc_lines, fc_line_categories |
| `psdata.js` | psdata_staging, app_data |
| `transferMatchGroups.js` | transfer_match_groups, transfer_match_group_members |

### Forecast Engine

Located in `server/src/v2/services/`. Generates multi-year financial projections:
1. Takes a scenario with modules (balance sheet items) and income/expense items
2. Applies growth rates, investments, disposals, and income percentage schedules
3. Produces yearly forecast entries stored in `forecast_entries`

---

## 7. Database

### PostgreSQL Schema

**Enum types:** `account_type` (asset, liability, equity, income, expense), `account_section` (balance_sheet, profit_loss)

#### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `accounts` | Chart of accounts with hierarchy (adjacency list via `parent_id`) |
| `categories` | PocketSmith categories mapped to accounts |
| `transactions` | Actual financial transactions (`accepted` flag protects from PS refresh overwrite, `transfer_matched` boolean set by Transfer Analysis for filtering matched/unmatched transfers) |
| `pending_transactions` | Staging for new/modified PocketSmith transactions |
| `budget_versions` | Named budget versions per year |
| `budget_entries` | Individual budget line items |
| `transfer_match_groups` | User-created manual match groups for transfer transactions |
| `transfer_match_group_members` | Links transactions to match groups (unique constraint: one group per transaction) |

#### Forecast Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `forecast_scenarios` | Named forecast scenarios |
| `forecast_modules` | Balance sheet forecast modules |
| `forecast_module_income_pct` | Module income percentage schedules |
| `forecast_module_investments` | Planned module investments |
| `forecast_module_disposals` | Planned module disposals |
| `forecast_income_expense` | Income/expense forecast items |
| `forecast_incexp_changes` | Scheduled income/expense changes |
| `forecast_entries` | Generated forecast output |

#### Configuration Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `forecast_assumptions` | Scenario-level or global assumptions (JSONB) |
| `exchange_rates` | Historical FX rates (market data from Frankfurter API) |
| `budget_fx_rates` | Monthly budget exchange rates per currency per year (user-managed, budget convention: X foreign per 1 USD) |
| `sync_metadata` | PocketSmith sync tracking |
| `audit_log` | Change audit trail (JSONB old/new values) |
| `psdata_staging` | Raw PocketSmith CSV/API data |
| `app_data` | Application metadata (last ingest/refresh timestamps) |

#### Views

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `v_balance_sheet` | Pre-joined balance sheet data |
| `v_budget_vs_actual` | Budget vs actual comparison with variance |

### Size

~29 MB, 20 tables, 25.5k transactions.

### Migrations

SQL migrations in `server/db/migrations/` run automatically on PostgreSQL container initialization via Docker's `initdb.d` volume mount. For existing databases, new migrations must be applied manually via `psql`.

---

## 8. Docker Services

### Production (`docker-compose.yml`)

| Container | Image | Ports | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| `fin-postgres` | postgres:16-alpine | 5433:5432 | PostgreSQL database |
| `fin-server` | Custom (Node.js 20) | 3005:3005 | Express API server |
| `fin-frontend` | Custom (nginx:alpine) | 3006:80, 5175:443 | SPA + API proxy |

All services connected via `fin_fin-network` Docker bridge network.

### Development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)

Database and backend run in Docker. Frontend runs locally via npm:

| Component | How it runs | Port |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `fin-postgres-dev` | Docker | 5434 |
| `fin-server-dev` | Docker | 3105 |
| Frontend | `npm run tail` (Vite) | 5174 |

Production and development use different ports, so both can run simultaneously.

### Volumes

**Production:** `postgres_data`, `./components/data`, `./components/reports`, `./certs`
**Development:** `postgres_data_dev`

---

## 9. Development Workflow

### Quick Start

```bash
ssh cfbieder@192.168.1.87
cd ~/psproject                     # or ~/Programs/fin (symlink)
./Scripts/dev-start.sh
```

Creates a tmux session (`fin-dev`) with 4 windows: database logs, backend (nodemon), frontend (Vite HMR), shell.

See [TMUX Guide](Guides/TMUX_GUIDE.md) for navigation details.

### Making Changes

- **Frontend** (`frontend/src/`): Save -> instant hot reload (Vite HMR)
- **Backend** (`server/src/`): Save -> auto-restart in ~1-2s (nodemon)
- **Database**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec fin-postgres-dev psql -U fin -d fin`

### Frontend Environments (`.env-cmdrc`)

| npm script | API Target | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| `npm run tail` | `http://100.94.46.62:3105` | **Development via Tailscale (recommended)** |
| `npm run dev` | `http://localhost:3105` | Development on the VM directly |
| `npm run docker` | (nginx proxy) | Production Docker build |

### Deploying to Production

```bash
./Scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
```

Backs up DB to `Backups/`, rebuilds containers, verifies health.

---

## 10. Scripts

All scripts are in the `Scripts/` folder.

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `dev-start.sh` | Start tmux dev environment | `./Scripts/dev-start.sh` |
| `deploy-to-production.sh` | Deploy to production | `./Scripts/deploy-to-production.sh [--with-git] [--no-backup]` |
| `sync-db-prod-to-dev.sh` | Copy prod DB to dev | `./Scripts/sync-db-prod-to-dev.sh` |
| `bump-version.sh` | Version management | `./Scripts/bump-version.sh patch\|minor\|major\|X.Y.Z` |
| `rebuild-frontend.sh` | Quick frontend rebuild | `./Scripts/rebuild-frontend.sh` |
| `backup-to-remote.sh` | Backup DB + config to 192.168.1.252; prune Docker resources >48h | `./Scripts/backup-to-remote.sh` (crontab: every 2 days) |
| `provision-vm.sh` | Create VM on KVM host | `ssh cfbieder@192.168.1.61 'bash -s' < Scripts/provision-vm.sh` |
| `deploy-on-vm.sh` | Deploy app on VM | `ssh cfbieder@192.168.1.87 'bash -s' < Scripts/deploy-on-vm.sh` |

---

## 11. Backup & Restore

### Automated Remote Backup

Automated backups run every 2 days at 2:00 AM via crontab, transferring to `192.168.1.252`.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Script | `Scripts/backup-to-remote.sh` |
| Schedule | `0 2 */2 * *` (every 2 days, 2 AM) |
| Remote | `cfbieder@192.168.1.252:/home/cfbieder/backups/fin/` |
| Retention | 30 days (auto-cleanup) |
| Log | `Backups/backup-remote.log` |

**What's backed up:** PostgreSQL dump, `.env` files, `components/data/`, `certs/`

**Docker cleanup:** Also prunes build cache, dangling images, stopped containers, and unused networks older than 48 hours.

```bash
# Manual remote backup
./Scripts/backup-to-remote.sh

# Dry run (preview only)
./Scripts/backup-to-remote.sh --dry-run

# View backup log
cat Backups/backup-remote.log

# List backups on remote
ssh cfbieder@192.168.1.252 "ls -lh /home/cfbieder/backups/fin/"
```

### Local Backup & Restore

Local backups are saved to the `Backups/` directory (git-ignored). The deploy script automatically creates a timestamped backup before deploying.

```bash
# Manual backup
mkdir -p Backups
docker exec fin-postgres pg_dump -U fin -d fin -Fc > Backups/fin_backup.dump

# Restore
docker exec -i fin-postgres pg_restore -U fin -d fin --clean --if-exists < Backups/fin_backup.dump

# Copy backup off-VM
scp cfbieder@192.168.1.87:~/psproject/Backups/fin_backup.dump ./

# Restore from remote backup
scp cfbieder@192.168.1.252:/home/cfbieder/backups/fin/fin_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz .
tar xzf fin_backup_*.tar.gz
docker exec -i fin-postgres pg_restore -U fin -d fin --clean --if-exists < fin_backup_*/database.dump
cp fin_backup_*/dot-env /home/cfbieder/psproject/.env
cp -r fin_backup_*/components-data/* /home/cfbieder/psproject/components/data/
cp -r fin_backup_*/certs/* /home/cfbieder/psproject/certs/
```

---

## 12. Git Hooks

A `prepare-commit-msg` hook automatically prepends version and date to all commit messages:

```
[v2.0.6 2026-02-13] your commit message here
```

Version is read from the `VERSION` file. The hook is local to this clone (`.git/hooks/`).

---

## 13. Environment Variables

Config uses `.env` file (git-ignored) for secrets, with defaults in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Default Value | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `findev123` | Database password |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://fin:findev123@fin-postgres:5432/fin` | Server DB connection |
| `PS_API_KEY` | (in docker-compose.yml) | PocketSmith API key |
| `PS_USER_ID` | `330430` | PocketSmith user ID |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Server environment |
| `PORT` | `3005` | Server port |

---

## 14. Data Files

Located in `components/data/` (mounted into server container):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `account_names.json` | PocketSmith account name mappings |
| `category_names.json` | PocketSmith category name mappings |
| `appdata.json` | Application metadata (last ingest/refresh timestamps) |
| `FCAssump.json` | Forecast assumptions (inflation, FX, tax rates) |
| `.temp/` | Temporary files for PS API refresh pipeline |

**COA in SQL:** The chart of accounts lives in the `accounts` table (adjacency list via `parent_id`) with `section` (balance_sheet / profit_loss) and `account_type` enums. The accounts repository provides `getNestedTree({ section })` returning `{ name, children }` trees via recursive CTE. All endpoints (reports, budget, forecast, COA management) use this SQL-based COA. The former `coa.json` and `coa_traits.json` files have been removed.
